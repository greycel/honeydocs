# Component Categories

Form components are grouped into categories based on how the component is used on the page. The categories are as follows:

**Input fields** - things that are read-write fields back to NetSuite

**Output fields** - data output but not readable like text in a paragraph connected to NetSuite

**Static Content** - components where the content is specified on the form not in NetSuite - used for things like headers or fixed text on the page

**Layout** - used for grids, cards and page structure

**Authentication**  - components specifically related to authentication to be used on the login screen for an app. 

**Lists -** list components which render list data based on saved search results in NetSuite
