# Creating a Honey App

## What is an App?

For key definitions on Honey Forms including what an App is, see the [Honey Forms Basics](./Honey-Forms-Basics-1cdfc74e-9c2e-4f9d-929c-17dc50fc8e83.md) page. Make sure you are familiar with these basic concepts before continuing. 

## Creating a new App

The steps in creating a first simple App are as follows:

1) Create the App record

2) Create the entry form  

3) Create a deployment record for the App

A list of Honey Apps can be found under the "Honey Forms" menu in NetSuite. By default this menu is only available on the Classic Center which users with the Administrator role will be able to see.

### Create the App Record

This step can be done by navigating to:

Honey Forms > Apps > Honey Apps > New

Fill out a name for the App - this name is only used internally and will not be visible to individuals logging into the App. 

Choose an App Theme. The theme determines the style of the pages which forms are displayed on. It is generally a good idea to make a copy of one of the existing themes so that it can be customized. But this is not necessary for a first simple app. 

Once the Name and the App Theme are selected, save the App record. We will come back to the App record and set the "Entry Form" field later once we have created a first form.
