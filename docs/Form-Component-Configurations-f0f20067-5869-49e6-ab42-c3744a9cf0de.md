**Container Form Component**
This field can be used to make a form component a child of another and this render inside of its content area. Select the container component here. If no container component is selected the form component will render directly on the form in the sequence specified. 

**Developer Name**
The developer name for a form component can be used to reference the component via JavaScript. A developer name is not needed unless specifically called for. If one is entered it must be unique for the form. More specifics on how this is used by form developers is given on the [Forms Data Structure](https://www.notion.so/Forms-Data-Structure-7992cfc58ba44fb8a300de79f8540a06) page.
